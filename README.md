# Car_Insurance_Prediction_model

• Objective -
Create a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will buy car insurance based on various variables. 
A health insurance provider is interested in expanding into the car insurance market. Based upon the given variables in the data set we need to predict if the customer is willing to buy the insurance or not.

We have 12 columns in total namely-
• Id
• Gender
• Age
• HasDrivingLicense
• RegionID
• Switch
• VehicleAge
• PastAccident
• AnnualPremium
• SalesChannelID
• DaysSinceCreated
• Result

Following steps need to be followed:
1) Data pre-processing
2) Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3) Model Implementation
4) Performance Evaluation
5) Results and Discussions

We implement the following machine learning algorithms –
1. Random Forest :
2. Decision Tree:
3. K- Nearest Neighbours:

Evaluation Metrics - 
1. Precison
2. F1 score
3. Recall
4. Accuracy
5. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC)
